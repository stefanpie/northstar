    <h1>About Northstar</h1>
    <p>
      Northstar is a hurricane forecasting application designed for forecasters.
      It focuses on explainable deep learning models, which are often treated as
      a black box in traditional approaches. Northstar seeks to integrate novel
      visualizations and deep learning techniques to make deep learning more
      accessible and understandable for hurricane forecasting.
